‚ö†Ô∏è High-Priority Action Items

1. Asset Symbol Management
   Need: Unique symbol generation per target
   Action: 
   - Implement symbol existence check before creation
   - Create function to generate unique symbols based on target address
   - Add symbol validation and collision detection
   Why: Prevent duplicate assets for same target
   Owner: Core Dev Team

2. Treasury Management
   Need: Protocol-admin controlled treasury address updates
   Action:
   - Implement time-delayed update mechanism
   - Add multi-sig verification requirement
   - Add events for treasury updates
